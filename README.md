# Stock_Price_Model
This repository contains code for analyzing and predicting stock market trends using historical data of various financial instruments such as natural gas, crude oil, copper, and major stock indices like S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and individual company stocks.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 39 columns with historical stock prices and volumes of various financial assets, including natural gas, crude oil, copper, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stocks of major companies such as Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Netflix, Meta, and more. It also includes precious metals like gold, silver, and platinum.

### Columns

- **Date**: The date of the observation
- **Natural_Gas_Price**, **Natural_Gas_Vol.**: Price and volume of natural gas
- **Crude_oil_Price**, **Crude_oil_Vol.**: Price and volume of crude oil
- **Copper_Price**, **Copper_Vol.**: Price and volume of copper
- **Bitcoin_Price**, **Bitcoin_Vol.**: Price and volume of Bitcoin
- **Ethereum_Price**, **Ethereum_Vol.**: Price and volume of Ethereum
- **S&P_500_Price**, **Nasdaq_100_Price**, **Nasdaq_100_Vol.**: Prices and volumes of S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices
- **Company stock prices**: Price and volume data for major companies like Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Netflix, Amazon, Meta, etc.
- **Gold_Price**, **Gold_Vol.**, **Silver_Price**, **Silver_Vol.**, **Platinum_Price**, **Platinum_Vol.**: Price and volume data for precious metals.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - The dataset is read from a CSV file.
   - The data is shuffled to randomize the order of records using `sample(frac=1).reset_index(drop=True)`.
   
2. **Data Exploration**
   - The `info()` function provides a summary of the dataset, including column types and the presence of null values.
   - The dataset contains some missing values (`NaN`) in the volume columns, which might require handling before model training.

3. **Visualization**
   - `matplotlib.pyplot` is imported for data visualization. The code can be extended to visualize stock price trends, correlations between different assets, and volume changes over time.

4. **Future Steps**
   - The next steps would involve cleaning the dataset (e.g., handling missing values, converting object columns to numerical data), feature engineering, and splitting the data into training and testing sets for machine learning model development.
   - Various machine learning models such as linear regression, LSTM, or Random Forests can be used to predict future stock prices based on historical trends.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization

## Installation

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset by running the code provided in the notebook.
2. Perform data exploration to understand the structure and cleanliness of the dataset.
3. Prepare the dataset for machine learning by handling missing values and feature scaling.
4. Train a machine learning model to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Future Improvements

- Handle missing data appropriately (e.g., using interpolation or dropping columns).
- Perform data visualization to gain insights from the dataset.
- Implement machine learning models for stock price prediction (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, LSTM, etc.).
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
